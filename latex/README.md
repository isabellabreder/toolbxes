# LaTeX

This image is used exclusively for LaTeX writing. I use a separate container just for that for two reasons:

1. Writing LaTeX is rather context agnostic, meaning I find myself doing it at Unicamp, at my IC, and at LKCAMP

2. The complete LaTeX scheme is nothing short of *huge*, with hundreds of dependencies taking many gigabytes of storage, so it isn't worth including in the `base` image
