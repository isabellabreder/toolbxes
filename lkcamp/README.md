# LKCAMP

This image is used for all activities related to LKCAMP, free software student
club I participate in. It pulls from the base image built in this repo and
installs a few packages for:

- the LKCAMP blog (`hugo`)
- rpm packaging (`rpmdevtools`, `rpmlint`)

Other development tools are packaged as Flatpak. That includes apps like GNOME
Builder, and runtimes like `libadwaita`.
