# Unicamp

This image is used for all curricular activities at Unicamp. It contains most
of the CLI software I needed throughout my graduation in Computer Engineering,
like compilers and interpreters for multiple languages (`julia`, `R`, etc).

Languages that are cubbersome to compile manually (I'm very explicitly looking
at you, Java) were installed using flatpak SDKs and made available to my IDE of
choice, also installed as a flatpak.

Other graphical applications, such as SciDAVis, were also installed as
flatpaks. In addition to that, some applications without proper support for
Fedora had their Windows version installed using Bottles, such as Tracker.
