# IC

This image is used for all activities related to my *Iniciação
Científica* (translates roughly to "Scientific Initiation"), which is a
research mentorship program for college students in Brazil. My IC revolves
around developing an open source platform for storing, organizing, and sharing
research data, analyses, and notes.

We chose to implement it as a website, so this container contains all
dependencies to develop and serve the project.
