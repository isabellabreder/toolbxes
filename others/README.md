# Others

This image is mainly used to install packages I would rather not layer on my
Fedora Silverblue system. Reasons for that include:

- Having too many dependencies (e.g. `gnome-tweaks`)
- Not being available as an rpm package (e.g. `ncspot`)

This container also serves as a "catch all" for packages that don't seem to fit
the purpose of the other containers in this repo.
